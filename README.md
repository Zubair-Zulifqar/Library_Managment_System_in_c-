The Library Management System is a comprehensive software application designed to revolutionize the way libraries handle their operations and manage their resources. 
Key Features:

Book Management: The system allows librarians to add new books by entering details such as title, author, genre, and publication year. Each book is assigned a unique identifier for easy tracking.

Display All Books: Librarians can retrieve and display the details of all the books in the library, including the book's identifier, title, author, genre, and publication year. This feature provides a comprehensive view of the library's inventory.

Search for a Book: Users can search for books based on various criteria such as title, author, or genre. The system displays the details of the books that match the search term, enabling users to quickly find specific titles.

Borrow a Book: Library members can borrow books by entering the book's identifier. The system checks the availability of the book and updates its status as borrowed. It also records the borrower's information for easy tracking.

Return a Book: Users can return borrowed books by entering the book's identifier. The system verifies if the book is currently borrowed and updates its status as returned. It removes the borrower's information from the book's record.

Serialization and File Handling: The system utilizes serialization to store book data in files, allowing for persistent storage and retrieval of information. It uses file handling techniques to read and write data to and from the files, ensuring data integrity and seamless data management.

Exception Handling: The system incorporates robust exception handling mechanisms to handle errors and unexpected scenarios. It provides appropriate error messages and ensures the application remains stable and reliable.

By implementing the Library Management System, librarians can streamline their operations, maintain accurate records of the library's inventory, enhance member services, and optimize resource management. The system provides an intuitive user interface, efficient book tracking, and seamless integration of serialization and file handling for data storage and retrieval.
